# Competitive Programming

I like to compete in competitive programming competitions. [This is a collection of some of the programs I have written](https://github.com/logan-anderson/competitive-programming). All of the questions come from [kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) and generally, the name of the file is the same name as the problem on kattis.  I have been practicing and competing for about 2 years.
